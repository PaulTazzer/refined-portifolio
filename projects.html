            <p>This is where I showcase the projects I've built as part of my school assignments or personal learning. Each project is a new lesson!</p>

                <h3>1. Simple GUI design applied. (Python.Tkinter)</h3>

                <h4>The Goal</h4>
                <p>Creating this simple GUI calculator was a fundamental exercise in learning Python's capabilities beyond the terminal. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with a standard Python GUI library, focusing specifically on widget placement, event handling, and binding functions to button clicks to implement the application's core arithmetic logic. This project solidified my understanding of how to translate backend code into a practical, interactive user interface.</p>
                
                <h4>What I Did</h4>
                <p>When creating the calculator, I first set up the GUI window using a Python library called Tkinter and designed the layout by arranging the display field and all numeric and operation buttons into a grid. I then implemented the core logic by writing event handler functions to capture button clicks, manage the input string, and use Python's built-in evaluation capabilities to calculate the final result, including basic error handling.</p>
                
                <h4>Key Takeaway</h4>
                <p>The main lesson was learning how to connect Python's code to the buttons and screen of a visible program. This taught me how to handle user clicks and show the results, making the code work as an actual, interactive application.</p>

                <img src="streamline booking.png" alt="Screenshot of the project" class="project-visual">
                <p>Building a simple design for a simple hotel booking page in HTML and CSS had two main goals: to create a good-looking and functional interface, and to show I could structure a complex form correctly. The key lesson was using Flexbox and CSS Grid to make the layout look great on all devices, and using semantic HTML to correctly build the booking form, image galleries, and information sections. This project taught me how to make a complete, high-quality, and responsive frontend design.</p>

                <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-20 075028.png" alt="Screenshot of the project" class="project-visual">
                <p>Designing a school robotics website aimed to create a clear, engaging layout and present project information in an organized way. I learned how to structure content effectively so team details, robot projects, and updates are easy to understand. The project helped me build a clean and polished site that showcases the robotics team’s work.</p>

                <img src="Screenshot 2025-11-20 080435.png" alt="Screenshot of the project" class="project-visual">
                <p>Creating a car services website for my friend focused on building a clean layout that clearly shows the services offered and makes it easy for customers to get information. I learned how to organize content so pricing, service options, and contact details are simple to find. The project helped me create a professional and easy-to-use site for a small business.</p>

                <p>Building a quote generator helped me practice creating simple, interactive features and added JavaScript to my skill set. I learned how to make dynamic content that updates instantly and keeps the page engaging. This project strengthened my ability to create small but functional tools that improve user experience.</p>
