                <p>I created a web-based calculator using Python and Flask. It allows users to enter two numbers, select an operation, and see the result immediately. The calculator handles errors such as division by zero and invalid input, and the interface is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

        Building a simple design for a simple hotel booking page in HTML and CSS had two main goals: 
        to create a good-looking and functional interface, and to show I could structure a complex form correctly. 
        The key lesson was using Flexbox and CSS Grid to make the layout look great on all devices, 
        and using semantic HTML to correctly build the booking form, image galleries, and information sections. 
        This project taught me how to make a complete, high-quality, and responsive frontend design.

                <p>Creating a car services website for my friend focused on building a clean layout that clearly shows the services offered and makes it easy for customers to get information. I learned how to organize content so pricing, service options, and contact details are simple to find. The project helped me create a professional and easy-to-use site for a small business.</p>

                <p>Building a quote generator helped me practice creating simple, interactive features and added JavaScript to my skill set. I learned how to make dynamic content that updates instantly and keeps the page engaging. This project strengthened my ability to create small but functional tools that improve user experience.</p>
