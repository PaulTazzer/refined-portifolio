            <h3>Why I Chose Coding</h3>
            <p>Coding gives me a sense of control and creativity. It lets me take ideas from my mind and turn them into something real on a screen. I enjoy the satisfaction of solving problems and improving with every project. The best part is that coding grows with me. The more I learn, the more I can create and express myself digitally.
                    <br><br>
                What I love most is that coding grows with me. The more I learn, the more I can express myself through the things I create.

            <h3>Featured School Project</h3>
            <p>
                I have worked on several projects that allowed me to practice and improve my coding skills. From building complete websites with HTML and CSS to experimenting with responsive layouts, colour schemes, and user-friendly designs, each project has taught me something new. These experiences have helped me appreciate the importance of clean, organized code and thoughtful, visually appealing designs.
